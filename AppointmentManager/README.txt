Directions: To run the program, load it up within IntelliJ and click the green arrow button. Then, enter "test" and "test" into the login screen
	to be brought to the main menu. Here, you can view appointments, sort them by weekly or monthly, add appointments, or even modify them from the database.
	You can also add customers into the database with the add button, modify customers with the modify button, or delete customers with the delete button.
	Note: You cannot delete a customer without first deleting appointments associated with them.
	Note: Appointments with the same customer cannot overlap, and appointment times can only be accepted between the business hours of 8am EST and 10pm EST (Subject to change due to daylight savings).

Report Description: I decided to make a report where it consolidates all of the customers by country
	and returns a tableview of the customers within it. I believe this would be very useful as more and more customers are added
	into the database, as having a list of all the customers within one country is very important for regional information gathering
	and distribution.
